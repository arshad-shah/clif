description: What is clif and why does it exist?
---

**clif** is a tiny, zero-dependency CLI framework for Node.js. It replaces the need for `commander`, `chalk`, `inquirer`, `ora`, and `cli-table3` — all in a single, composable package under 16 KB gzipped.

## Why clif?

Building CLI tools in Node.js typically means pulling in a constellation of packages:

- `commander` or `yargs` for argument parsing
- `chalk` or `kleur` for colors
- `inquirer` or `prompts` for interactive input
- `ora` for spinners
- `cli-progress` for progress bars
- `cli-table3` for tables

Each comes with its own API patterns, version constraints, and transitive dependencies. **clif** unifies all of this into one package with zero dependencies.

## Design principles

- **Zero dependencies** — nothing in `node_modules` except clif itself
- **Composable** — every function is standalone, pure where possible, and returns strings
- **Tree-shakeable** — import only what you need via `clif`, `clif/prompts`, or `clif/banner`
- **Fast** — no startup overhead, no config parsing, no plugin system
- **Type-safe** — full TypeScript with strict types throughout
- **Testable** — output components return strings, making unit testing trivial
- **Respectful** — honors `NO_COLOR`, `FORCE_COLOR`, pipe detection, and terminal width
